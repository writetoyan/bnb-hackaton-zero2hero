## Project abstract: 

This project is about to empower e-commerce with the blockchain technology to have more transparancy, security and efficiency when buying online. We are targeting group buying business model. Companies can offer product sells on discount if a treshold is obtained or buyers can group together to offer to buy a product from a target company.

Advantages using blockchain for consumers:

- Their money is hold by a smart contract until they receive their product.
- The money is send to the sellers only if a certain percentage of buyers vote for the conformity / satisfaction of the product with the description provided. 
- They can buy without spending time searching if the seller / product is legit. 

Advantages using blockchain for companies: 

- No more credit card fees on each sells. Everything is packed on a single withdraw and hence a minimized blockchain transaction fee. 
- They can be sure to be paid if their product is as described.
- The product of the sell can be put to work on different DeFi protocol while the whole selling process is being processed.
- Less doubt from the consummer means more and faster sells to boost revenu
